# Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
# Assignment:
# Create four classes:

# A with a method show(),

# B and C that inherit from A and override show(),

# D that inherits from both B and C.

# Create an object of D and call show() to observe MRO.


# solution

class A:
    def show(self):
        print(" Show from Class A")
    
class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print(" Show from Class B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print(" Show from Class C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

obj = D()
obj.show()

print("ðŸ§­ MRO:", [cls.__name__ for cls in D.__mro__])
