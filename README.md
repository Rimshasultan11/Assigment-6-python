# üêç Python OOP Assignments (21 Concepts Covered)

This repository contains 21 basic-to-intermediate level Python OOP assignments. Each assignment focuses on one concept of Object-Oriented Programming. It's great for beginners to understand how OOP works in Python.

## üìö List of Assignments with Topics:

1. **Using self**
   Create a `Student` class with name and marks. Use `self` to initialize values and display details.

2. **Using cls**
   Create a `Counter` class that tracks how many objects are created using a class method.

3. **Public Variables and Methods**
   Create a `Car` class with a public variable and method, and access them outside the class.

4. **Class Variables and Class Methods**
   Create a `Bank` class with a class variable `bank_name` and update it using a class method.

5. **Static Variables and Static Methods**
   Create a `MathUtils` class with a static method to add two numbers.

6. **Constructors and Destructors**
   Create a `Logger` class that prints a message when the object is created and destroyed.

7. **Access Modifiers: Public, Private, Protected**
   Create an `Employee` class with public, protected, and private variables and test their access.

8. **super() Function**
   Use `super()` in a `Teacher` class to call the parent `Person` class constructor.

9. **Abstract Classes and Methods**
   Use `abc` module to define an abstract class `Shape` and implement it in a `Rectangle` class.

10. **Instance Methods**
    Create a `Dog` class and define an instance method that prints a custom message.

11. **Class Methods**
    Create a `Book` class with a class method to count how many books are created.

12. **Static Methods**
    Create a `TemperatureConverter` class to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using a static method.

13. **Composition**
    Use an `Engine` class inside a `Car` class and call the engine method via the car object.

14. **Aggregation**
    Create `Department` and `Employee` classes where a department holds an independent employee reference.

15. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**
    Use diamond inheritance to observe Python's method resolution order.

16. **Function Decorators**
    Write a function decorator that logs when another function is called.

17. **Class Decorators**
    Create a class decorator that adds a `greet()` method to any class.

18. **Property Decorators**
    Use `@property`, `@setter`, and `@deleter` to manage a private attribute in a `Product` class.

19. **callable() and **call**()**
    Create a `Multiplier` class that behaves like a function using `__call__()`.

20. **Custom Exceptions**
    Create a custom `InvalidAgeError` and raise it if age is less than 18.

21. **Making a Class Iterable**
    Create a `Countdown` class that supports iteration from a start number down to 0.

## üß† Learning Outcome:

* Understand how classes and objects work
* Practice encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
* Use decorators and dunder methods (`__call__`, `__iter__`, etc.)
* Get familiar with exception handling and abstraction
